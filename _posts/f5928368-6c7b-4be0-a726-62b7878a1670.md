### **Hello, everyone!**

My name is **Truong Le Vinh Phuc**, and I’m excited to share my academic journey and career path with you. Although I am currently in my third year at the **University of Information Technology (UIT)**, part of Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City, I’ve already completed most of my coursework thanks to my focused efforts in earlier semesters. Now, I’m working on my **thesis** and **final-year project**, which will mark the culmination of my undergraduate studies. 

This blog post will walk you through my experiences, challenges, and milestones, as well as how I ended up at **Katalon**, where I currently work.


&nbsp;

### **The Foundation: University of Information Technology (UIT)**

My journey began at **UIT**, where I am pursuing a **Bachelor of Software Engineering** degree. Over the past few years, I have consistently achieved "Very Good" grades, maintaining a GPA of **8.37/10**—a testament to my dedication and hard work. 

While academics are important, I didn’t stop there. I took every opportunity to apply what I learned in real-world scenarios, whether it was leading teams, developing scalable systems, or diving into cutting-edge technologies.

Some of the key skills I’ve honed during this period include:

- **Backend Development**: Mastering frameworks like **Node.js**, **NestJS**, **Express.js**, and **Spring Boot**.
- **Frontend Development**: Building intuitive interfaces with **React.js** and **React Native**.
- **Database Management**: Working with both relational (**PostgreSQL**, **SQL Server**) and non-relational databases (**MongoDB**, **Firebase**).
- **DevOps Practices**: Implementing CI/CD pipelines using tools like **Docker**, **Jenkins**, and **GitHub Actions**.

These experiences laid the foundation for my career and gave me the confidence to tackle complex projects.


&nbsp;

### **Internships and Early Career: FPT Software**

One of the most transformative experiences in my early career was my internship at **FPT Software**, where I worked as a **Java Backend Developer Intern**. In this role, I led a team of seven as the **Scrum Master**, developing RESTful APIs for an online course platform using **Spring Boot**. I also optimized the **PostgreSQL** database performance, significantly improving system efficiency. Additionally, I streamlined deployment processes by implementing **CI/CD pipelines**, ensuring faster and more reliable releases.

This experience taught me the importance of teamwork, leadership, and agile methodologies. It also reinforced my passion for backend development and system optimization—a passion that continues to drive me today.


&nbsp;

### **Projects That Shaped Me**

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve worked on several exciting projects that allowed me to apply my skills and creativity. Here are some highlights:

#### 1. **E-Commerce Application with Microservices Architecture**

As the **Backend Developer** and **Software Architect**, I designed and implemented five independent microservices for an e-commerce platform. Using technologies like **.NET Core**, **RabbitMQ**, **MongoDB**, and **Docker**, I built a scalable and maintainable system that leveraged **Event-Driven Architecture** for seamless communication between services. This project deepened my understanding of modern software architecture and cloud-based solutions.


&nbsp;

#### 2. **Resort Management System**

Leading a team of five, I developed a **Resort Management System** using **NestJS**, **React.js**, and **MongoDB**. The system featured reservation management, billing, financial reporting, and employee management. By integrating third-party payment gateways like **PayOS**, we ensured smooth transactions for users. This project honed my skills in **MVC architecture**, **JWT authentication**, and **Google OAuth 2.0**.


&nbsp;

#### 3. **Blockchain-Based Online Notarization Platform**

As the **Backend Leader**, I contributed to building a secure and efficient digital notarization platform using **Ethereum blockchain** and **Solidity smart contracts**. This project introduced me to the world of blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize industries like legal documentation. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that expanded my technical horizons.


&nbsp;

#### 4. **Emotion Detection Web App**

In one of my personal projects, I developed an **Emotion Detection Web App** using **Flask**, **React Native**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow**. The app classified emotions from portrait images, leveraging machine learning techniques like **HOG feature extraction**. This project was a great way to combine my interests in AI and full-stack development.


&nbsp;

### **Career Choices: Why Katalon?**

Although I received offers from prestigious companies like BOSCH Vietnam, I ultimately chose to join Katalon because of its exceptional working environment, clear career growth opportunities, and the chance to learn from highly skilled colleagues. At Katalon, I’ve found a workplace that fosters collaboration, innovation, and continuous learning—values that align closely with my personal and professional goals. 

The supportive environment allows me to thrive while contributing to meaningful projects that push the boundaries of software development and testing. Additionally, the company’s focus on empowering developers and testers with cutting-edge tools resonates deeply with my passion for technology and quality assurance. Every day at Katalon presents an opportunity to grow, innovate, and make a real impact.


&nbsp;

### **Looking Ahead**

As I reflect on my journey so far, I’m filled with gratitude for the opportunities I’ve had and the people who’ve supported me along the way. From my days at UIT to my current role at Katalon, every step has been a learning experience that has brought me closer to achieving my goals.

Moving forward, I’m excited to continue growing as a software engineer and contributing to impactful projects. Whether it’s exploring new technologies, mentoring aspiring developers, or tackling complex challenges, I’m committed to making a difference in the tech industry.


&nbsp;

### **Final Thoughts**

My journey hasn’t always been easy, but it’s been incredibly rewarding. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s the importance of staying curious, embracing challenges, and never stopping your pursuit of knowledge. To anyone reading this, I encourage you to follow your passions, take risks, and trust in your ability to grow and adapt.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my journey. I hope it inspires you to pursue your dreams and make the most of every opportunity that comes your way!
