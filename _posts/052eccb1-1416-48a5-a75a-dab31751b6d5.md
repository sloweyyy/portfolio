I’ve always believed that a good engineer is shaped by curiosity long before credentials. My name is **Truong Le Vinh Phuc**, and I’m a DevOps/Software Engineer who enjoys building systems that are fast, reliable, and—hopefully—useful. My journey started long before I knew what microservices or Kubernetes were, but over time, those became the languages I think in.

I’m currently studying **Software Engineering at UIT – VNUHCM**, where I’ve been fortunate to maintain strong results, but university has never been the whole story. Most of what I’ve learned came from building things that were too big for me at the time—then slowly growing into them.

Today, my work spans across backend engineering, DevOps automation, and cloud-native development. I move between Java, .NET, Node.js, Go, and Python depending on what the problem needs. I’ve designed microservices, orchestrated systems with Docker and Kubernetes, built event-driven architectures with Kafka and RabbitMQ, and shipped CI/CD pipelines that keep everything moving without drama. I like infrastructure that behaves quietly.

I currently work as an **AI Product Support Engineer at Katalon**, where I lead the product and engineering efforts for the **Katalon Support Assistant**—an AI-driven platform that has reduced support case volume by 30 percent. It’s a role that blends technical depth, product thinking, and communication, and it has taught me how much impact thoughtful automation can create.

Before that, I was a **Java Backend Developer Intern at FPT Software**, where I led a team of seven and learned what it really means to ship production-ready software under pressure. Leadership, I’ve learned, is less about authority and more about clarity and momentum.

Outside of work, I build things—sometimes small, sometimes overly ambitious. Some highlights I’m proud of:

* a **carbon credit management platform** built with Go microservices and full Kubernetes observability
* a **cloud-native e-commerce system** with polyglot persistence and a service mesh
* a **blockchain notarization platform** that won **First Prize at IT Hackathon 2025**
* ML tools, cross-platform apps, real-time systems, and other experiments that taught me more than any course ever could

Along the way, I’ve picked up experience across AWS, Azure, Prometheus/Grafana, ELK, IdentityServer, OAuth2, and enough design patterns to keep my future self slightly less confused.

At heart, I’m someone who loves learning—deeply, consistently, sometimes obsessively. I enjoy the feeling of improving a system, simplifying something complex, or building a tool that makes someone else’s day easier. And I’m still early in the journey. There’s so much I don’t know yet, but that’s what keeps all of this interesting.

If any of this resonates, you can find me at **[slowey.dev](https://slowey.dev)**, **[GitHub](https://github.com/slowey-dev)**, or **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/truonglevinhphuc/)**.
I’m always building, always exploring, and always looking for the next idea worth pursuing.
