Hi everyone! My name is **Truong Le Vinh Phuc**, and I’m a **Backend Software Engineer** with a passion for building scalable, reliable, and innovative solutions. Currently, I’m in my third year pursuing a **Bachelor of Software Engineering** at the **University of Information Technology (UIT)** in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Over the past few years, I’ve honed my skills in **backend development** using technologies like **Node.js**, **NestJS**, **Spring Boot**, and **Express.js**, as well as working with databases like **MongoDB**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Firebase**. I also have experience in **DevOps practices**, implementing CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployment processes.

I’ve had the opportunity to work on exciting projects, from developing **microservices-based e-commerce platforms** to creating **blockchain-powered notarization systems**. These experiences have taught me the importance of teamwork, problem-solving, and continuous learning.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or designing creative solutions to real-world problems. I’m always eager to take on new challenges and grow both personally and professionally.

Feel free to connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sloweyne)** or check out my projects on **[GitHub](https://github.com/sloweyyy)**. Let’s build something amazing together!
