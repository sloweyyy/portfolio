# Introducing Truong Le Vinh Phuc

Hello, I’m Truong Le Vinh Phuc, a dedicated Software Engineer with a year of experience in crafting mobile applications using React Native and Java for Android. Currently based in Di An, Binh Duong, I’m passionate about creating user-centric solutions and leveraging the latest technologies to deliver outstanding mobile experiences.

My journey began with a focus on design, where I worked as a Graphic Designer at UIT – INSECLAB and THE BIG NEST F&B. During this time, I developed promotional materials that significantly boosted engagement and brand awareness.

I’m pursuing my degree in Software Engineering at the University of Information Technology in Ho Chi Minh City, where I have consistently achieved excellent grades. My academic background complements my technical skills, which include expertise in React Native, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase, and various other tools and frameworks.

In addition to my formal education, I have earned certifications in Data Science, Microservices, Agile Software Development, and AWS, among others. These certifications have enhanced my understanding of modern development practices and tools.

## Notable Projects

- **Coffee Shops Management:** A comprehensive system for managing orders, payments, and inventory, developed using React Native and Node.js.
- **ENIGMA:** An e-commerce platform for personalized t-shirts and tote bags, featuring AI-generated designs and integration with printing providers.
- **EmotionSense:** A web application that uses machine learning to classify emotions from images, built with Flask, React Native, and TensorFlow.
- **PROJECTX:** A multi-purpose application tailored for Vietnamese users, incorporating text-to-speech, face matching, and real-time translation features.

My work has been recognized with awards such as Third Place in the GDSC IDEA CONTEST 2023 for "FutureConnect," a platform designed to connect students and businesses.

I’m always excited about new opportunities and challenges. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sloweyne) or [GitHub](https://github.com/sloweyyy). Let’s work together to create something amazing!
